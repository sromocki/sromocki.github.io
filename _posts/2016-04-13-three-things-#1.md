3.  Basic DNS Record Types

| Name | Description |
|-------|---|
| A - Address Record | 32 bit IPV4 - maps hostnames to ip addresses |
| A + Dynamic DNS Record | Method of automatically updating a name server in the Domain Name System (DNS), often in real time, with the active DDNS configuration of its configured hostnames, addresses or other information |
| AAAA - Quad A Record | 128 bit IPV6 - maps hostnames to ip addresses |
| CNAME - Canoncial Name | Alias of one hostname to another |
| NS - Name Server | Delegates a DNS zone to use the given authoritative name servers |
| SRV - Service Locator | Generalized service location record, used for newer protocols instead of creating protocol-specific records such as MX. |
| TXT - Text record | Originally for arbitrary human-readable text in a DNS record. Since the early 1990s, however, this record more often carries machine-readable data, such as specified by RFC 1464, opportunistic encryption, Sender Policy Framework, DKIM, DMARC, DNS-SD, etc. |
| URL Redirect Record | Can be used for publishing mappings from hostnames to URIs. |
